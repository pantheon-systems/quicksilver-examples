# Quicksilver Environment Inspector #

This example is intended for users who want to explore the potential for Quicksilver with a quick environment export example. The contents of $_POST and all of the environment variables are displayed in the Quicksilver workflow log.

Setting up this example is easy:

1. Add the example `inspect.php` script to the `private` directory of your code repository.
2. Add a Quicksilver operation to your `pantheon.yml` to fire the script after cache clears.
3. Fire up terminus to watch the workflow log.
4. Push everything to Pantheon.
5. Clear the caches and see the output!

### Example `pantheon.yml` ###

Here's an example of what your `pantheon.yml` would look like if this were the only Quicksilver operation you wanted to use:

```yaml
api_version: 1

workflows:
  clear_cache:
    after:
      - type: webphp
        description: Inspect quicksilver environment
        script: private/scripts/inspect.php
```

### Example `terminus workflows watch` Output ###

Triggering cache clears from your dashboard you should enjoy nice debugging output like this:

```shell
$> terminus workflows watch --site=your-site-name
[2015-12-15 03:17:26] [info] Watching workflows...

The `wf_type`, `wf_description` and `user_email` values are likely to be of particular interest. You can get additional information from the `$_SERVER` and `$_ENV` superglobals. You can also interrogate the status of the git repository, as well as bootstrapping the CMS. There are lots of possibilities! Have fun with Quicksilver!
