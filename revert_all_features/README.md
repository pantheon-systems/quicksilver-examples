# Revert All Features Logs #

This example will show you how to integrate drush commands into your quicksilver operations


## Instructions ##

Setting up this example is easy:

1. Add the example `revert_all_features.php` script to the 'private/scripts/' directory of your code repository.
2. Add a Quicksilver operation to your `pantheon.yml` to fire the script before a deploy.
3. Test a deploy out!

Optionally, you may want to use the `terminus workflows watch` command to get immediate debugging feedback.

### Example `pantheon.yml` ###

Here's an example of what your `pantheon.yml` would look like if this were the only Quicksilver operation you wanted to use:

```yaml
api_version: 1

workflows:
  deploy:
    after:
      - type: webphp
        description: Revert All Features
        script: private/scripts/revert_all_features.php
```
